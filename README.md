## Credits & Libraries
Handheld Companion (HC) is the result of countless hours of work by enthusiasts and the community, who have provided feedback and shared access to their devices. HC reliers on the drivers and libraries of [Nefarius](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus), [https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX](SharpDX), [https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL](SDL) but also the reverse engineering efforts of Handheld Daemon, GHelper, SteamDeckTools. Finally, HC was made possible thanks to the support from a few OEM partners like AYANEO, ASUS and MSI who've been providing samples to support the development.
